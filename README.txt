This Android app is a learning exercise, from this thread:
http://androidcommunity.com/forums/f44/gps-coordinates-locator-68855/

The user types in a coordinate (or selects the current location from the menu), 
then the app shows you the distance and bearing to there from your current location.
An arrow is also shown to point you in the right direction.
